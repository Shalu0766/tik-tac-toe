# Tic-Tac-Toe in Python

## Introduction
This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. Two players can play the game alternately, entering their moves by selecting a numbered position on the board.

## How to Play
1. Run the script using Python.
2. The game will display a 3x3 grid with numbers representing positions.
3. Players take turns entering a number (0-8) to place their mark ('X' or 'O').
4. The game checks for a winner after each turn.
5. The game ends when a player wins or all spaces are filled.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Running the Game
To start the game, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

## Game Rules
- Player 'X' starts first.
- Players take turns choosing an empty position (0-8) to place their mark.
- The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
